<!--Note that many of the jobs can be done without the use of so many tags. But, the extensive use of tags help search engines to understand better what your web page is about. It allows them to quickly search through your document and know what it is about. Therefore, there is a higher chance that your page will be on the list of searches of google-->

Here we also see the use of attributes in a tag. meta is the tag, which has attributes charset, name, content. Each of these attributes have a value associted with them. Also always define meta tag in the head of a html document. Many html tags have attributes that enable the browser to render them effectively-->

					Hello World this is an article on programming. C++ and Java are personally the two languages that I excel in.<br/>
					Not just that, I also think that these two languages are kind of like the pillar stones of computer science in general<br/>
				</section>
				<section>
					C++ code is very close to the machine and is practically a wrapper over assembly language..of course ignoring the <br/>libraries that need to be additionally invoked by the g++ compiler. Java<br/> is also a game changer because of its byte code strategy.
